# Generating component

Go inside any React project including project generated by [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) or [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) or [Arclix](#) to generate a component

```bash
npx arclix generate component [COMPONENT NAME]
```

or

```bash
npx arclix g c [COMPONENT NAME]
```

The above command will

-   create a folder named `[COMPONENT NAME]` and generate the component inside the created folder that will reside on the folder you run the command.

-   will automatically take `template` and `stylings` for the component from the React project.

-   generate it inside `src` directory by default If you run the command in the root folder.

:::caution
You cannot run this command outside of `React` project .
