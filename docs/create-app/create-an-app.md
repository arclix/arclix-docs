# Creating an App

### Create your first React Page

To create a React app run this command:

```bash
npx arclix create [PROJECT NAME]
```

**_Note:_** It uses [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) by `Facebook` as a base to create a react project and add additional dependencies according to your needs.

After running the `create` command you'll be prompted with following questions

1. What template would you like to use?
    ```
    [TEMPLATE]
    ├── JavaScript
    └── TypeScript
    ```
2. What styling would you like to use?
    ```
    [STYLING]
    ├── CSS
    └── SCSS/SASS
    ```

Then it will create a directory named `[PROJECT NAME]` inside the current folder based on the prompts.
